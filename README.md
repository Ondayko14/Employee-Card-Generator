# Employee-Card-Generator
HTML/CSS/Javascript/Node/Inquirer/Jest/Bootstrap

## How it works
Start the application by running node index. Then follow the prompts to build your team of employees! The Application will allow you to add as many members as you would like to your team, and when you are done it will display your team members on a index.html file for you. The file will already be styled and ready to go for your viewing pleaseure. And that's about it!

### Troubles Along The Way
I Focused a lot on using the TDD concept in this project. I would say that getting the basics of testing setups down, was a bit challenging. As I continued to press thru the testing proccess, however, I found it becoming more and more intuitave.
